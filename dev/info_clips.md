- In general, this is How I want to be able to operate with my data
- Using the following abstractions:
- a) Item - e.g. todo. A singular thing. Simple line of text
- "Clip" or "Click" or "Clump" - a few of related items batched together
- c) Queue / Context 
    - A thematically related sequence of items
    - Chronologically or by priority
---
- If only I could arrange all my data into meaningful clips.. that'd be amazing!
